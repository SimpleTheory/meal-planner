Creation:
    Get lazy/busy friends to contribute their assets
    -- Shopping Page Lazy Load ✔ (Need to Test)
    -- Create a CQRS saving model (In development on separate branch) ✔ (Need to test and merge)

CQRS:
    Comprehensive Testing (Including Test on Local Phone After Back Ups)


Documentation:
    Add gifs and more detailed guide on usage in readme
    Add documentation in to the code and generate code docs for it

Questions:

Known things/Qs for later:
- Overwriting
- Desktop compatibility:
    • Create copy of project without stupid barcode scanner or kill its bridge
    • Implement features like local back up and file saving
    • find what other plugins may inhibit this and refactor
- QoL:
    - Plus sign doesn't disappear behind search when searching
    - days didnt update when showing rahawa but cant replicate bug
    - reorder glitches out sometimes (replicate it)
    - improve on UI elements of different things, for ex: alt measures to cards
Ideas?:
    summon api directly from searchbar (in ingpage)?
    ing measure pref for shopping list?
