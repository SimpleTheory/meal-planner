Questions:

Known things/Qs for later:
- Overwriting
- Saving
- Desktop compatibility:
    • Create copy of project without stupid barcode scanner or kill its bridge
    • Implement features like local back up and file saving
    • find what other plugins may inhibit this and refactor
- QoL:
    - Plus sign doesn't disappear behind search when searching
    - days didnt update when showing rahawa but cant replicate bug
Ideas?:
    summon api directly from searchbar (in ingpage)?
