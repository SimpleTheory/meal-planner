Creation:
    (- get lazy/busy friends to contribute their assets)

Things not working:
-  if one more image gets a HTTP exception closed error I think I'm going to blow a casket
   • if local/(internet) image not found default to back up instead of erroring.
   • cache the images with https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image perhaps,
    According to some stack Overflow users this might deal with the exception as well

Questions:
-  MCTile (only in mealmaker page) nutrient re total or re per serving? (or toggleable)

Known things/Qs for later:
- Overwriting
- Saving
- Desktop compatibility:
    • Create copy of project without stupid barcode scanner or kill its bridge
    • Implement features like local back up and file saving
    • find what other plugins may inhibit this and refactor

Ideas?:
    ing measure pref for shopping list?
