Modify Domain such that MealComponents save a deepcopy of references
        - Make cascading changes to App object based on modified references
        - Maybe ref count

Shopping List Page Still Lags a bit when opening a tab with 100+ objects

Desktop/iOS compatibility
    • Create copy of project without stupid barcode scanner or kill its bridge
    • Implement features like local back up and file saving
    • find what other plugins may inhibit this and refactor



-----------------------------------
Minor Notes
    Documentation:
        Add gifs and more detailed guide on usage in readme
        Add documentation in to the code and generate code docs for it

    Known things/Qs for later:
    - Overwriting
    - Desktop compatibility:
        • Create copy of project without stupid barcode scanner or kill its bridge
        • Implement features like local back up and file saving
        • find what other plugins may inhibit this and refactor
    - QoL:
        - Plus sign doesn't disappear behind search when searching
        - days didnt update when showing rahawa but cant replicate bug
        - reorder glitches out sometimes (replicate it)
        - improve on UI elements of different things, for ex: alt measures to cards
    Ideas?:
        summon api directly from searchbar (in ingpage)?
        ing measure pref for shopping list?
